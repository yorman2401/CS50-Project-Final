Greetings CS50 teachers! My project is about a website called “Hotels Query”, to query places in anywhere of the world where you want to stay,
by showing a list of available hotels, their stars, their address, the number of reviews and their prices. In addition, through login in the website,
you can add the hotels you like to a wish list, which is used to save the hotels of the places where you want to travel at some moment,
or remove hotels from the list of wishes if later you are not interested in staying at that hotel.
In turn, the people registered on the website can change the username, password of their account and even delete the account.
I designed the website with the Material Kit library which is based on Bootstrap, and it facilitated the implementation of nav bars, dropdown buttons,
modals, badges, cards, alerts and among other useful components. Also, I programmed some additional functions of the website with JavaScript and,
the server I did it in Python communicating with the TripAdvisor API to access the information of the hotels and, thus, generate a list for the users of my website.
In conclusion, if you need to query hotels quickly in an elegant, easy to understand and intuitive place, the best thing is that you visit “Hotels Query”
website created and designed by Yorman Rodríguez.
